# My Mac Setup

Documenting my system setup for reinstalls after a complete crash, etc.

How to use: Open an issue each time I need to setup a new machine, paste [the checklist](checklist.md) from this readme, and follow the steps.


## Contents

| `.bash-profile` | Customizes the iTerm prompt. |
| `.bash-login` | Customizes my iTerm colors |
| `.gitconfig` | Global Git configuration to specify my name and email, shortcuts, colors, and more. |

| `.zshrc` | Config file for ZSH |

## Use it yourself

Fork this repo, or just copy-paste things you need, and make it your own. **Please be sure to change your `.gitconfig` name and email address though!**
